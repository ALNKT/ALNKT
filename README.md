<h3 align="center">Hi there, I'm Alex :raised_hand:</h3>
<h4 align="center">Enthusiastic, attentive, purposeful. I strive for new knowledge, always aiming for the best result.</h3>

A couple of years ago I bought a smart speaker with a voice assistant inside, and that's how it all started.
I decided to start designing and developing a smart home, although I didn't know anything, but I was very interested. 
I began to explore the expanses of the Internet and start small, then I bought a smart light bulb, then a smart socket.
Thus, I got a server based on Raspberry Pi and a large set of devices for a smart home, automation and scenarios, 
apartment layouts, etc.

All this captured me, and I decided to expand my knowledge and capabilities in the form of learning a programming 
language. I chose Python. I finished free courses, read information on the Internet. At first, it was more for myself, 
to write, for example, a skill for a voice assistant or something else simple. But the more I delve into everything, 
the more interesting and difficult it becomes. And I decided to get a Python developer profession.

Now I am successfully acquiring new knowledge, and I am not going to stop there!
